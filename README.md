If you prefer the cloud (nothing to download or install):
https://posit.cloud/      [you can login with your Google account without making a separate acct]

### If you are interested in learning python instead, some starting points are provided below.

(1) If you want to learn data science, here is a set of python notebooks:

Running python programs is easy if you use colab, which can be set up through Google drive. Just go to https://colab.research.google.com/
and click Google Drive and then "new notebook" to get started.  

(2) If you want to learn python programming at a very introductory level, I suggest:
