If you prefer the cloud (nothing to download or install):

### If you are interested in learning python instead, I suggest:

(1) If you want to learn data science, here is a set of python notebooks:

I can show you how to run jupyter notebooks in colab if you are interested. Very easy to set up through Google drive. 

(2) If you want to learn python programming at a very introductory level, I suggest:
